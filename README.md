# nested_nav_examples
Further examples extended from https://github.com/ntshTiwari/nested_nav
- Simplified code base to make it easier to integrate with your app
- Tab, drawer (master/detail), and adaptive examples

The drawer example is less than ideal with two AppBars, and I'd recommend the adaptive example in general, though you could change what your styling to look good.
