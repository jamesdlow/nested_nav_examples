# nested_nav_examples
Further examples extended from https://github.com/ntshTiwari/nested_nav
- Simplified code base to make it easier to integrate with your app
- Tab, drawer, and adaptive examples

The drawer example is less than ideal with two AppBars and is mainly there to show what is possile. I'd recommend the adaptive example in general if you want a drawer or master/detail based design, though you may be able to style nested AppBars to look good.
